- 👋 Hi, I’m @Elxas866
- 🎓 I'm a professional software developer; educated at HTL Wr.Neustadt, Austria
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and working on something that makes myself and others happy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java through Minecraft (Spigot) Plugins, C# with the .NET Framework, JavaScript through Discord.js, Python through small games and school and having fun with web design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some little projects which I can make a little money with whilst going to school. Nothing laborious, you know...
