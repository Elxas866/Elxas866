- 👋 Hi, I’m @Elxas866
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and working on something that makes myself and others happy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java through Minecraft (Spigot) Plugins and having fun with web design and a little bit of JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some little projects which I can make a little money with whilst going to school. Nothing laborious, you know...
- 📫 How to reach me is via Discord: Elxas866#2552, or email: [eliaskelta1@gmail.com](mailto:eliaskelta1@gmail.com)
- 🌐 Make sure to check out my website to get more information about me.
